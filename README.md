## Central Mindanao University - Digital Archiving System

A System created based on Laravel. 

Ever since the CMU started its services, the documents are manually stored in a physical space, a stack of boxes, filing cabinets full of documents or copies. The main drawback of this method is that it is cumbersome and slow to use. Finding information with paper documents can take hours, even days, in some cases. The University archive itself needs to an upgraded to provide better service, preservation, and accessibility. This proposal would be beneficial to the Records Management Unit (RMU). The researcher proposed an alternative technology to provide a digital archive, long-term preservation, and digital collections access.

The researcher comes up with a possible solution for this problem. Digital Archiving, switching from paper to digital document management and archiving, can help the Records Management Unit reduce physical storage space and ease day-to-day operations. Computer hardware can pull up digital documents, search their contents, and sort and catalogue information in seconds. The proposed system is the "Central Mindanao University Digital Archive System." The RMU had digital copies of all documents through the proposed system, and those digital files can be store on hard drives, local servers, and the cloud. Enables the RMU to organize essential files and provides an easy way for the files to locate and retrieved when needed.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
